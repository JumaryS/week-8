# week-8
Week-8


I missed the first day of the week but during the rest of the week, we focused on DOM again. We had several projects to help us use DOM instead of CSS. We used document.querySelector(the class or id of the HTML will be placed within the parentheses)

The projects  from editing CSS code to modifying the HTML to creating apps. 

Today day 2 of class we created a roll the die app where we had to roll the die/dice as we clicked on the image the image will change to numbers and pass the median, mean and mode of the given numbers(we had to make the numbers random). 


We learned about flex box 

CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as Flex-box, is a CSS  layout model.  The flex layout allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending upon screen size.Â 

We used Flex-box to help organize divs used to create a fake instagram page. We worked in pairs which was not easy.
